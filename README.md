## Project Overview
This project implements a multimodal AI chatbot capable of answering questions about YouTube videos using both text and voice inputs. The system leverages automatic speech recognition (Whisper), large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Pinecone as the vector database.

## Goal ðŸŽ¯
The main goal is to build a smart assistant that can:
- Extract and understand content from YouTube videos.
- Support voice and text input from users.
- Retrieve factual answers from video content(voice and/or text).
- Evaluate hallucinations and retrieval accuracy.
