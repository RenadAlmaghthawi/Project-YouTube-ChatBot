3. Chooses **output mode**: text or voice  
4. Backend:
   - Preprocessing the video
   - Stores the video URL in a database
   - Passes the question to the **agent**
   - Agent selects the appropriate tool (search, summary, quiz, etc.)
   - LLM generates a response
5. The response is returned to the user as text or speech

## Evaluation
* **Hallucination Detection:**
   - Compares the LLM's response with source data.
   - Calculates a hallucination score (0 = factual, 1 = fully hallucinated).

* **Retrieval Evaluation:**
   - Precision@K and Recall@K are computed to evaluate the relevance of retrieved content.

Question: What is the ‚Äútechnological gaze,‚Äù and how does Elise Hu define it?

Answer: The "technological gaze" is defined by Elise Hu as an algorithmically driven perspective that people learn to internalize, perform for, and optimize for. It is a process where machines take in our data and learn to perform us in an endless feedback loop. This concept manifests itself in how we present ourselves online, often through the use of filters or editing tools to alter our appearance, driven in part by AI-generated beauty standards. Hu mentions how these digital alterations can impact real-world beauty standards, creating a gap between our real appearances and the filtered images we present online. The technological gaze can thus contribute to issues of self-image and perpetuates a narrow, potentially harmful standard of beauty.
